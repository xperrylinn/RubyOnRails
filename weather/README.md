# Ruby on Rails

This is an example project of a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) web application that runs in Glitch.com.

## Notes
- Using Ruby on Rails v5.1.4 with Ruby v2.3.1 
- Glitch instances only have 128mb of disk space so it will be unusable to devolop using this environment.
- Added the `.gemrc` file to avoid installing documentation to use as less disk space as possible.
- Includes an axample of a `glitch.json` file allowing the application to run with the default Glitch configuration.
